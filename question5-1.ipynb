The `len` of an iterator is the number of batches in the iterator.\n","\n","You may recall when initializing the `LABEL` field, we set `dtype=torch.float`. This is because TorchText sets tensors to be `LongTensor`s by default, however our criterion expects both inputs to be `FloatTensor`s. Setting the `dtype` to be `torch.float`, did this for us. The alternative method of doing this would be to do the conversion inside the `train` function by passing `batch.label.float()` instad of `batch.label` to the criterion."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":92,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-22T21:27:27.377345Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-22T21:27:27.377070Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-22T21:27:27.386978Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-22T21:27:27.386157Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-22T21:27:27.377323Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708630407671,"user":{"displayName":"NTAMBARA ETIENNE","userId":"18202463506283693713"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"nqCbCqPuH1tU","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["def train(model, iterator, optimizer, criterion):\n","\n","    epoch_loss = 0\n","    epoch_acc = 0\n","\n","    model.train()\n","\n","    for batch in iterator:\n","\n","        optimizer.zero_grad()\n","\n","        text, text_lengths = batch.text\n","\n","        predictions = model(text, text_lengths).squeeze(1)\n","\n","        loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)\n","\n","        acc = binary_accuracy(predictions, batch.label)\n","\n","        loss.backward()\n","\n","        optimizer.step()\n","\n","        epoch_loss += loss.item()\n","        epoch_acc += acc.item()\n","\n","    return epoch_loss / len(iterator), epoch_acc / len(iterator)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mjgL4FpwH1tU"},"source":["`evaluate` is similar to `train`, with a few modifications as you don't want to update the parameters when evaluating.\n","\n","`model.eval()` puts the model in \"evaluation mode\", this turns off _dropout_ and _batch normalization_.
