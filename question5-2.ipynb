Note, you do not need to do `model.forward(batch.text)`, simply calling the model works. The `squeeze` is needed as the predictions are initially size _**[batch size, 1]**_, and we need to remove the dimension of size 1 as PyTorch expects the predictions input to our criterion function to be of size _**[batch size]**_.\n","\n","The loss and accuracy are then calculated using our predictions and the labels, `batch.label`, with the loss being averaged over all examples in the batch.\n","\n","We calculate the gradient of each parameter with `loss.backward()`, and then update the parameters using the gradients and optimizer algorithm with `optimizer.step()`.\n","\n","The loss and accuracy is accumulated across the epoch, the `.item()` method is used to extract a scalar from a tensor which only contains a single value.\n","\n","Finally, we return the loss and accuracy, averaged across the epoch. The `len` of an iterator is the number of batches in the iterator.\n","\n","You may recall when initializing the `LABEL` field, we set `dtype=torch.float`. This is because TorchText sets tensors to be `LongTensor`s by default, however our criterion expects both inputs to be `FloatTensor`s. Setting the `dtype` to be `torch.float`, did this for us. The alternative method of doing this would be to do the conversion inside the `train` function by passing `batch.label.float()` instad of `batch.label` to the criterion."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":60,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-22T21:21:16.078283Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-22T21:21:16.076362Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-22T21:21:16.086661Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-22T21:21:16.085776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-22T21:21:16.078252Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1708634563495,"user":{"displayName":"NTAMBARA ETIENNE","userId":"18202463506283693713"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"nqCbCqPuH1tU","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["def train(model, iterator, optimizer, criterion):\n","\n","    epoch_loss = 0\n","    epoch_acc = 0\n","\n","    model.train()\n","\n","    for batch in iterator:\n","\n","        optimizer.zero_grad()\n","\n","        text, text_lengths = batch.text\n","\n","        predictions = model(text, text_lengths).squeeze(1)\n","\n","        loss = criterion(predictions, batch.label)\n","\n","        acc = binary_accuracy(predictions, batch.label)\n","\n","        loss.backward()\n","\n","        optimizer.step()\n","\n","        epoch_loss += loss.item()\n","        epoch_acc += acc.item()\n","\n","    return epoch_loss / len(iterator), epoch_acc / len(iterator)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mjgL4FpwH1tU"},"source":["`evaluate` is similar to `train`, with a few modifications as you don't want to update the parameters when evaluating.\n","\n","`model.eval()` puts the model in \"evaluation mode\", this turns off _dropout_ and _batch normalization_.
